- JavaScript Project - **Color Flipper**

### Overview
---

- In this Project mainly Math.Random() and Math.floor() are the main focus.
The color numeration is generated randomly based on the collection of item in an array, in our case, "numbers", which eventually update the background color of DOM's body. They also get displayed in a span located at the center of the container. This is generated with a click of a button.

- For the bonus point,  we use event listener, for the button to generate the code, as well as a for loop, to loop through the items in our Array.
